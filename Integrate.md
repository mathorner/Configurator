# Integrate learning with reflection

1. What surprised you?
The level of pragmatism it appeared to show. I was able to wrangle it to small, iterative changes and it seemed to follow that without too much embellishment. The agent would tell me that it was skipping some things because we didn't need them just yet and it was correct. For example, it mocked out the data source rather than creating the full db just so that we could test the API was building and running first. I didn't tell it to do that.

2. What frustrated you?
I use Codex and I was excited to see OpenAI had just released a VS Code extension for it. My experience was good but it does still have some bugs. For example, I redocked the chat window and my entire chat history was gone which was very frustrating.
I was also frustrated at my rusty IDE knowledge. I wasted a lot of time just trying to get the test panel to appear for example.

3. How would you rate your planning efforts?
Good. This is where I spent most of my time

4. Did you experience any overwhelm?
Not really. Just anxiety due to not having enough time!

5. How did you find not hand-writing code?
I like it. I can read C#, JS, SQL, etc and it turns out I can read other languages as well like python, C++. Having an agent to worry about the correct syntax is a great productivity boost for me. I can focus my energy on the overall plan and architecture.

6. How will this experience influence you going forward?
It's given me the drive to do more and apply my experience else where. I just need to figure out how I could combine my experience with this new technology in my role.
